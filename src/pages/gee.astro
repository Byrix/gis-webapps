// I had hoped to have more time to play around with this. I know it's possible to make GEE apps locally and then use OAuth client-side so users have to use their own GEE-enabled Google accounts to run things. GEE editor is amazing but I found it super clunky once you start trying to add UI elements and styling. 

import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout.astro';
// import { GeeMap } from '../components/gee';
// import GeeSkeleton from '../components/GeeSkeleton.astro';

<MainLayout title="GEE App">
  <!-- <GeeMap> -->
  <!--   <GeeSkeleton slot='fallback' /> -->
  <!-- </GeeMap> -->
</MainLayout>
