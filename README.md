# GIS Web App Examples
Repo containing two examples of a GIS-based web application. Built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [ReactJS](https://react.dev). 

## CesiumJS
First app is built on the [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/) platform. It provides a 3D web map showing the [Lilydale - Warburton Rail Trail](https://www.yarraranges.vic.gov.au/Explore-Yarra-Ranges/Parks-Recreation/Lilydale-to-Warburton-Rail-Trail), a popular trail in outer-Eastern Melbourne, Victoria following the historic rail line that once connected Lilydale to Warburton. 

## Google Earth Engine
The second app is built using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) (GEE)
